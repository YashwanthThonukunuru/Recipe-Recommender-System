# Recipe Recommender System

## Overview

This repository contains the project work for the Recipe Recommendation Systems. The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate recommender systems for suggesting recipes to users based on their past reviews and other information. The project involves implementing content-based, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization models to create effective recommendation systems.

## Project Details

In this project, we are tasked with building and evaluating various recommender systems:

- **Content-Based Recommender:** Utilizing information about recipes, such as tags, descriptions, and more, to recommend recipes based on users' preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering Model:** Recommending recipes by leveraging past users' reviews and interactions to find similarities and make suggestions.
- **Matrix Factorization Model:** Implementing matrix factorization techniques to uncover latent factors that contribute to users' preferences and generating recommendations.

## Dataset and Links

The dataset for this project is provided through the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recommender-systems-2023/data) page. It includes past reviews, textual descriptions, star ratings, recipe tags, and more.

## Approach

We have comoleted this project by

- Implementing and evaluating the recommender systems using best ML practices.
- Utilized a training, validation, and test split and tuned hyperparameters.
- Provided a concise conclusion that reviews the implemented approaches and assesses their performance.

## Contribution

This repository serves as a demonstration of the Recipe Recommender System project. Feel free to suggest improvements!
